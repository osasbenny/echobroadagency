    longDescription: '"Dear Youth, This Is How Not to Be a Fool at 40” is more than a book — it’s a survival guide for today’s youth navigating the unpredictable road to adulthood. This is your Cheat Card to Success Before 40, drawn from the real-life lessons of over 100 high achievers aged 40 and above — people who’ve made the mistakes, learned the hard truths, and are now passing the torch. Experience they say, is the best teacher but like I always add, not your experience but others as you may not live to tell yours. As Sir Isaac Newton once said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” This book hands you that shoulder — so you can rise above confusion, avoid common pitfalls, and see clearly the path to purpose, fulfillment, and early success. Click below to gain access to timeless wisdom your future self will thank you for.',
